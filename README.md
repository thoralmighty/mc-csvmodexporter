# mc-csvmodexporter
Exports information about installed Minecraft mods to a CSV file.

## How to use
 * Place `CsvModExporter.exe` in either your ".minecraft" or "mods" folder and run it, that's it!
 * If you want the CSV file to open automatically (for import to e.g. Excel) there is an `/open` argument you can use. Create a shortcut to `CsvModExporter.exe` by holding Alt and dragging it to an empty area in the same folder, then right-click it and go to Properties. Edit the "Target" field so that it ends with `CsvModExporter.exe /open`, finally click OK. You can then rename the shortcut to anything you like.
